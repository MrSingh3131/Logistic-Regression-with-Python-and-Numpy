# Logistic-Regression-with-Python-and-Numpy
Logistic Regression with Python and Numpy


Course Objectives
In this course, I am going to focus on two learning objectives:

- Implement Logistic Regression using Python and Numpy.
- Apply the implementation to solve binary classification problems.


By the end of this course, I was able to create and train a logistic model that was able to predict if a given image is of hand-written digit zero or of hand-written digit one. The model was able to distinguish between images or zeros and ones, and it would do that with a very high accuracy. Not only that, my implementation of the logistic model was also able to solve any generic binary classiﬁcation problem. I would still have to train model instances on speciﬁc datasets of course, but I won’t have to change the implementation and it will be re-usable.



Project Structure
The project on Logistic Regression is divided into following tasks:

- Task 1: Introduction

Introduction to the problem.

Libraries and helper functions.

- Task 2: Hyperparameters

Setting initial values for hyperparameters.

Why are we choosing certain values for the hyperparameters?

- Task 3: Dataset

Loading the dataset.

Understanding the shape of the examples.

Plotting a few examples to visualize the examples and labels in the dataset.

- Task 4: A Mini Batch of Examples

Get a random mini batch of examples.

Understanding unrolling 2-dimensional arrays.

Plotting multiple examples along with their labels.

- Task 5: Create Model

Start implementing the Logistic Model class.

What is the logistic equation?

Defining an initialization function.

- Task 6: Forward Pass

Implementing the internal Forward Pass function.

Understanding the loss function.

Understanding the shape of weight parameters.

- Task 7: Backward Pass

A brief word on gradient descent and back-propagation.

Calculating gradients for the weight and bias parameters.

- Task 8: Update Parameters

Updating the weight and bias parameters with the gradients obtained from backward pass.

- Task 9: Check Model Performance

Implementing a function which returns predictions given batch of examples.

Implementing a function which evaluates model performance on a given batch of examples and labels.

We will check the implementation of the evaluation function on a random batch.

We will also visualize model performance with a few examples.

- Task 10: Training Loop

Implementing the training loop. Each training iteration performs the following steps:

- Get a new random batch.
- Perform a forward pass to get activation output.
- Perform a backward pass to get gradients.
- Update the parameters using the gradients.

- Task 11: Training the Model

We will now create a new instance of the Logistic Model.

We will evaluate the model before it is trained.

We will train the model.

We will evaluate the model after it is trained.

We will also plot validation accuracies and losses from during the training.

Finally, we will visualize model performance on a random batch.

- Task 12: Additional Example (Optional)

We will use the Logistic Model implementation to solve a different binary classification problem. We still have to load, normalize and process the dataset. However, the implementation does not need any changes and can be applied as is to solve this new problem.
